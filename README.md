# ChromaCreator
A Java application (with a Python script) to convert any image into a RazerChroma profile consisting of a static layer of all the colors of the image. Additionally, an optional reactive (or soon ripple) layer can be added over the static image. Additionally provides a GUI interface for easy use. _Output .razerchroma files is currently dumped in the project directory._
  
So far, profiles exported only support the creation of static images, with an optional reactive layer overhead. _Ripple layer appears in the GUI, but is not implemented in the program code._ 

Coming up:  
    > Save file output beyond dumping the file in the project directory.  
    > Optional Ripple Layer over the Static layer. (Choice of None, Ripple, or Reactive)  
    > Moving the Python script back into Java.  
    > Finish updating the CLI to provide same functionality as GUI.
