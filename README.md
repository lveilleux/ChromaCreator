# ChromaCreator
A Java application (with a Python script) to convert any image into a RazerChroma profile consisting of a static layer of all the colors of the image. Only static images and layers are supported at this point.
  
So far, profiles exported only support the creation of static images. _the reactive layer color picker is not used currently_.  

Coming up:  
    > Save file output beyond dumping the file in the project directory.  
    > Reactive Layer over the Static layer.  
    > Moving the Python script back into Java.
