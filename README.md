A Java application to convert any image into a RazerChroma profile consisting of a static layer of the image. Additionally, an optional reactive layer can be added over the static image. This program can be used with a JavaFX GUI, or via the Command Line.
  
So far, profiles exported only support the creation of static images, with an optional reactive layer overhead.

Coming up:  
    > More profile layer options
